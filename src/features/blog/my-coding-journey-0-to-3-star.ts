    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-900">
      Eight months ago, I couldn't solve a simple two-pointer problem. Today, I'm a 3-star coder on CodeChef with a 2100+ rating on LeetCode and over 1000 DSA problems under my belt. This isn't a story about natural talent or shortcuts—it's about consistency, strategy, and learning from countless failures.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
      If you're starting your DSA journey or feeling stuck, this post is for you. I'll share exactly what worked, what didn't, and the mindset shifts that made all the difference.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">April 2025: The Starting Line</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      I had programming experience—I'd built AI/ML projects, worked with Python and Java, and understood basic syntax. But competitive programming? That was a different beast entirely. My first LeetCode Easy problem took me 30 minutes and 2-3 wrong submissions. I didn't even know what time complexity meant beyond "make it fast."
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      The wake-up call came during a coding interview. I froze on a medium-level array problem that the interviewer said was "standard." That's when I realized: building projects and solving algorithmic problems require completely different skill sets. I needed to get serious about DSA.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
      <strong>Starting Stats (April 2025):</strong>
    </p>
    <ul class="mb-6 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>LeetCode: ~100 problems solved (mostly Easy)</li>
      <li>CodeChef: Unrated</li>
      <li>Understanding: Could implement basic loops and conditionals, struggled with anything beyond that</li>
      <li>Confidence: Rock bottom</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">The Strategy: Building a Foundation (April - June)</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      I spent the first two months building fundamentals. No contests, no hard problems—just focused learning. Here's what worked:
    </p>

    <h5 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">1. Pattern Recognition Over Random Solving</h5>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      Instead of randomly picking problems, I followed a structured approach. I focused on one pattern at a time:
    </p>
    <ul class="mb-6 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Week 1-2:</strong> Arrays and Hashing (Two Sum, Contains Duplicate, Group Anagrams)</li>
      <li><strong>Week 3-4:</strong> Two Pointers (Container With Most Water, 3Sum, Trapping Rain Water)</li>
      <li><strong>Week 5-6:</strong> Sliding Window (Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, Minimum Window Substring)</li>
      <li><strong>Week 7-8:</strong> Binary Search (Search in Rotated Sorted Array, Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
      For each pattern, I'd solve 15-20 problems, starting with Easy, moving to Medium, and attempting 1-2 Hard problems. The key was understanding <em>why</em> a pattern worked, not just memorizing solutions.
    </p>

    <h5 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">2. The 20-Minute Rule</h5>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      If I couldn't solve a problem in 20 minutes, I'd look at the solution. But here's the crucial part: I wouldn't just read it—I'd:
    </p>
    <ol class="mb-6 text-gray-700 list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>Understand the approach conceptually</li>
      <li>Close the solution and implement it myself</li>
      <li>Come back to the same problem 3 days later and solve it from scratch</li>
      <li>Revisit it again after a week</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
      This spaced repetition was game-changing. Problems I struggled with became second nature.
    </p>

    <h5 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">3. Daily Consistency Over Marathon Sessions</h5>
    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
      I committed to solving 3-5 problems daily, no matter what. Some days I'd spend 3 hours, other days just 45 minutes. But I never skipped a day. By June, I'd solved 300+ problems and my LeetCode rating crossed 1600.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">The Breakthrough: Entering Contests (July - August)</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      July was when I started participating in contests. My first CodeChef contest? I solved 1 out of 5 problems and ranked in the bottom 30%. It was humbling, but I learned more from that one contest than from solving 50 practice problems.
    </p>

    <h5 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">Contest Strategy That Worked:</h5>
    <ul class="mb-6 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li><strong>LeetCode Weekly Contests:</strong> Every Sunday, without fail. Even if I could only solve 1-2 problems, I participated.</li>
      <li><strong>CodeChef Weekly Contests:</strong> I will try to solve atleast 3 problems in CodeChef contest</li>
      <li><strong>Post-Contest Analysis:</strong> After every contest, I'd spend 2-3 hours understanding problems I couldn't solve during the contest.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      By August, I was consistently solving 2-3 problems in LeetCode contests and reached 1-star on CodeChef. My rating was around 1800 on LeetCode.
    </p>

    <h5 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">The Mental Game</h5>
    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
      Contests taught me something crucial: competitive programming is 50% algorithms and 50% mental game. I learned to stay calm when stuck, manage time effectively, and not panic when I saw others solving problems faster. This mindset shift was as important as any algorithm I learned.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">The Grind: Pushing to 2100+ (September - November)</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      The jump from 1800 to 2100+ was the hardest part of my journey. At this level, you're competing with people who've been doing this for years. Here's what made the difference:
    </p>

    <h5 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">1. Advanced Topics Deep Dive</h5>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      I spent September mastering advanced topics:
    </p>
    <ul class="mb-6 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Solved 100+ DP problems. Started with 1D DP, moved to 2D, then tackled state machine DP and DP on trees.</li>
      <li><strong>Graphs:</strong> BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Union-Find, Topological Sort. Solved every graph problem I could find.</li>
      <li><strong>Trees:</strong> Binary trees, BSTs, segment trees, and Fenwick trees.</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced Data Structures:</strong> Heaps, tries, and monotonic stacks/queues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">2. Problem Difficulty Progression</h5>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      I started attempting more Hard problems. My approach:
    </p>
    <ul class="mb-6 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>Spend 30-45 minutes trying to solve it myself</li>
      <li>If stuck, read hints (not full solution)</li>
      <li>Implement and debug thoroughly</li>
      <li>Study optimal solutions and learn new techniques</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">3. Contest Performance Optimization</h5>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      I analyzed my contest performance and identified patterns:
    </p>
    <ul class="mb-6 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>I was spending too much time on problem 1-2, leaving less time for harder problems</li>
      <li>I wasn't reading all problems before starting to code</li>
      <li>I was making silly mistakes under time pressure</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
      I adjusted my strategy: quickly scan all problems, identify the easiest ones, solve those first, then tackle harder problems. This simple change improved my contest ranking significantly.
    </p>

    <h5 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">4. The Final Push</h5>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      October and November were intense. I was solving 5-7 problems daily, participating in 3-4 contests per week, and reviewing my mistakes religiously. By mid-November:
    </p>
    <ul class="mb-6 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>LeetCode rating: 2100+</li>
      <li>CodeChef: 3-star (1600+ rating)</li>
      <li>Total problems solved: 1000+</li>
      <li>Contest performance: Consistently solving 3-4 problems in LeetCode contests</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Key Lessons & Mistakes to Avoid</h4>
    
    <h5 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">What Worked:</h5>
    <ul class="mb-6 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Consistency over intensity:</strong> Daily practice beats weekend marathons</li>
      <li><strong>Pattern-based learning:</strong> Understanding patterns > memorizing solutions</li>
      <li><strong>Contest participation:</strong> Real pressure teaches you things practice never will</li>
      <li><strong>Spaced repetition:</strong> Revisiting problems after days/weeks solidifies understanding</li>
      <li><strong>Community learning:</strong> Discussing approaches with others on Discord and forums</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">What Didn't Work:</h5>
    <ul class="mb-6 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Random problem solving:</strong> Jumping between topics without structure</li>
      <li><strong>Only solving Easy problems:</strong> Comfort zone is the enemy of growth</li>
      <li><strong>Skipping contests:</strong> "I'll participate when I'm ready" is a trap</li>
      <li><strong>Not reviewing mistakes:</strong> Making the same error twice is inexcusable</li>
      <li><strong>Comparing with others:</strong> Focus on your own progress, not others' speed</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Resources That Helped Me</h4>
    <ul class="mb-6 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet:</strong> Comprehensive coverage of all topics</li>
      <li><strong>LeetCode Discuss:</strong> Reading others' solutions taught me new approaches</li>
      <li><strong>CodeChef Practice:</strong> Great for building contest stamina</li>
      <li><strong>TakeUForward YouTube:</strong> Excellent explanations for complex problems</li>
      
    </ul>

    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">The Reality Check</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      Let me be honest: this journey was hard. There were days I wanted to quit. Days when I couldn't solve a single problem. Days when I saw others progressing faster and felt inadequate.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      But here's what I learned: everyone's journey is different. Some people reach 2100+ in 3 months, others take a year. What matters is that you keep showing up.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
      The skills I've gained go beyond just solving problems. I think more clearly, debug faster, and approach complex problems with confidence. These skills have already helped me in technical interviews and will continue to benefit my career.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">What's Next?</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      I'm not stopping here. My goals for the next 6 months:
    </p>
    <ul class="mb-6 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>Reach 4-star on CodeChef</li>
      <li>Cross 2300+ on LeetCode</li>
      <li>Solve 1500+ total problems</li>
      <li>Participate in Codeforces and reach Expert level</li>
      <li>Help others on their DSA journey through mentoring</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Final Thoughts</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      If you're reading this and thinking "I could never do that," you're wrong. Eight months ago, I thought the same thing. The difference between where I was and where I am now isn't talent—it's consistency, strategy, and refusing to give up.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
      Start today. Solve one problem. Then another. Then another. In 8 months, you'll look back and be amazed at how far you've come.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700">
      The journey from zero to 3-star isn't about being the smartest person in the room. It's about being the most persistent. And that's something anyone can choose to be.
