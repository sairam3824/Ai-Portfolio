Welcome to the **Ai-Portfolio** repository! This project showcases two distinct versions of a modern, AI-integrated portfolio website, demonstrating the evolution of design and technical capabilities.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository contains two versions of my personal portfolio:

*   **Version 1:** Needs to be run manually. It features a complete AI-driven interface with a chat assistant, showcasing foundational AI integration and web development skills.
*   **Version 2:** The latest, production-ready version. It is highly optimized, features a polished UI/UX, and includes advanced features like a rotating typewriter effect, section-specific footers, and improved responsiveness. This version is designed for deployment and performance.
